# Basic-Image-Classification
This work describes the problem that I was trying to solve visually. I want to create and train a model that takes an image of a hand written digit as input and predicts the class of that digit, that is, it predicts the digit or it predicts the class of the input image.


# Required Tools and Technologies
1) Python 3.10 or above
2) TensorFlow
3) Keras (TensorFlow API)
4) MNIST dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/code/ngbolin/mnist-dataset-digit-recognizer/data)
5) One-Hot Encoding
6) Neural Networks (Model Create, Optimized and avaluated)
